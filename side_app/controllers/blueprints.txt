Blueprints can be used to do lots of stuff - 
they're not just controllers! Blueprints are basically 
a way of defining some of the properties of a Flask app 
in advance, so that you can pick when that definition takes 
effect, and even apply your defined behaviour to multiple 
apps if you want. As an example, we'll use blueprints later 
to create new terminal commands for our app. 

For now, though, we need a controller, 
so let's create a blueprint that tells Flask how our 
controller should work.
