You can put favicons, special fonts, background images, etc here, and they'll all be available to slot into your templates.
It's possible at a pinch to let users upload images here as well, but this isn't common practise, because it chews up storage, and if you're using a cloud instance to serve your website you probably don't have much space to spare.
We are going to set up our image upload system to place files here first, but only so we can see what's going on behind the screens. Once we have it working, we'll move the upload storage location from /static/ to an AWS S3 bucket
